# Introduction

Over the years, Java has proliferated in Alibaba. Many applications are written in Java and many our Java developers have written more than one billion lines of Java code.

Alibaba Dragonwell, as a downstream version of OpenJDK, is the OpenJDK implementation at Alibaba optimized for online e-commerce, financial, logistics applications running on 100,000+ servers. Alibaba Dragonwell is the engine that runs these distributed Java applications in extreme scaling.

Alibaba Dragonwell is clearly a "friendly fork" under the same licensing terms as the upstream OpenJDK project. Alibaba is committed to collaborate closely with OpenJDK community and intends to bring as many customized features as possible from Alibaba Dragonwell to the upstream.
